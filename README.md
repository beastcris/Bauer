Multithreading optimization of matrix multiplication

Implemented ThreadPool and TaskQueue, from wich thread pool takes tasks to complete

Plans: implement server, which gets these types of requests:

1) To multiple matrixes
2) To know the status of task (multiplication)
3) To get the result of multiplication if its done
